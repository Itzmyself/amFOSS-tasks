I am actually a big fan of pokemon but this task was very confusing.
First of all, the requirements they gave was all outdated so I thought maybe they forgot to update it.
So I just downloaded the latest version of it but then I realized that the script would only load if it meets the requirement.
So before downloading the requirements I had to shift to an older version of python as the requirements won't run in the new version.
I did everything inside the virtual env as it's the safest approach and they also suggested the same.


## COMMANDS USED

``sudo apt install python3.10 :``  Old version of python so that it meets the requirements criteria.

``python3.10 -m venv poke_env :`` Created a virtual env where that python version is the default.

Then I followed the steps in the github repository
