# UBUNTU INSTALLATION
<br>
<br>
It's not my first time dual-booting as I had Linux mint in my laptop. But for a change I thought 'what if I install ubuntu ,removing mint'. I can say that I'm glad that I made that decision as ubuntu is so user-friendly and we can easily access the files in windows.It is also very fast and battery usage is very low. Maybe time to uninstall windows .
