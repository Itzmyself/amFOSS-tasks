## FIELDS OF INTEREST AND HOW I PLAN TO WORK ON THEM
As I'm a bio student, I'm not realy aware of my field of interest.I like to solve problems and do some coding,etc.I am sure by joining amFOSS I will get to know my interests and will start working on them.As for now I am pretty interested in AI,ML and Data science which explains why I chose AIDS branch eventhough it's still a new branch.
