## APPROACH
**CHALLENGE-1**

I used cd and ls command to navigate to 'TheCommandLineCup'. I found out that x=6 as 6 was the first perfect number and y=5 by solving that equation. From these clues I got the spell which was Impedimenta and got the code by executing it from the spellbook.

**CHALLENGE-2**

In this challenge I found out that x=3 and y=2 as the element which was firt used to make semiconductors was germanium whose atomic number is 32. From these clues I got the spell which was Stupefy and got the code by executing it from the spellbook. 

**CHALLENGE-3**

In this challenge it was asked to switch to a branch was which DefenceAgainstTheDarkArts and then I was given a riddle by the Sphinx. By solving the riddle which was Boggart I found out the spell which can be used to defeat it, that is Riddikulus. I copied this spell to the spellbook of the main branch and then got the code by executing it.

**CHALLENGE-4**

After Sphinx cleared the way ,I switched to the graveyard branch where voldemort was waiting for me. While fighting with him, a rare phenomenon 'Priori Incantatem' which helped me to escape. I copied this spell to the spellbook of the main branch and then got the code by executing it.

**CHALLENGE-5**

After some struggling in decoding I finally decoded the code and got the link: https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell   
THE AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION I GOT WAS IMMEASURABLE. Harry potter franchise was one of my favourite and this task gave me a nostalgic feeling.
